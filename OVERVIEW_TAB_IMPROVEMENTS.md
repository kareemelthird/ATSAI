# âœ… Candidate Profile Overview Tab - Improved!

## ðŸŽ¨ What Was Improved

### Better Layout
- âœ… Changed from 2-column grid to cleaner single-column + 3-column grid layout
- âœ… Professional Summary now full-width at top
- âœ… Key info cards (Compensation, Location, Languages) in responsive 3-column grid
- âœ… Better spacing and hierarchy

### Visual Improvements
- âœ… Added colored icons for each section (green for money, blue for location, purple for languages)
- âœ… Reduced font sizes for labels (using `text-xs` instead of `text-sm`)
- âœ… Better contrast and readability
- âœ… Cleaner card styling
- âœ… Improved badge colors (blue theme for locations)

### Structure Changes
**Before:**
```
[Professional Summary - Full Width]
[Compensation] [Location & Mobility]
[Languages - Full Width Spanning 2 Columns]
```

**After:**
```
[Professional Summary - Full Width, Clean]
[Compensation] [Location & Mobility] [Languages]
(3-column responsive grid)
```

## ðŸ“Š API Usage Concern

You mentioned "test usage without ai api i see that i used much" - this is expected because:

### Current System Behavior
1. **System API Key Still Works** - Soft enforcement approach
2. **Warnings Shown** - But users can still proceed
3. **No Hard Limits** - System key has no usage counter

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Hard Enforcement (Recommended)
Block AI operations completely without personal key:

```python
# In backend/app/services/ai_service.py
async def analyze_resume(...):
    if not (current_user and current_user.use_personal_ai_key):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Personal API key required. Please add your free Groq API key in Profile settings."
        )
```

#### Option 2: Usage Counter
Track system API usage per day/week and block after limit.

#### Option 3: Remove System Key
Set `GROQ_API_KEY=""` in `.env` to force personal keys.

Would you like me to implement **Hard Enforcement** to completely require personal API keys?
