# 🔒 System API Key Restriction - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective

Force users to add their personal Groq API keys instead of relying on the system default API key which now has very limited usage.

## 📋 Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. AI Service Warnings (`backend/app/services/ai_service.py`)

**Modified Functions:**
- `analyze_resume()` - Added warning log when user doesn't have personal key
- `chat_with_database()` - Added warning log when user doesn't have personal key

**Warning Messages:**
```python
print(f"⚠️  WARNING: User {email} using system API key (very limited)")
print(f"⚠️  Encourage user to add personal Groq API key at /profile for better performance")
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ System API key still works (for backward compatibility)
- ⚠️ Backend logs clear warnings when system key is used
- 🔑 Personal keys are prioritized and logged with: `🔑 Using personal API key for user: {email}`

### Frontend Changes

#### 2. Dashboard Warning Banner (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Yellow warning banner at top of dashboard
- Shows when user doesn't have personal API key configured
- Includes "Add Personal API Key" button linking to `/profile`
- Dismissible (with X button)

**Features:**
- ⚠️ Prominent warning icon
- 🎁 Emphasizes it's **free** (no credit card)
- 🔗 Direct link to Profile page
- 📊 Checks API settings on every page load

#### 3. Upload Resume Warning (`frontend/src/pages/UploadResume.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Warning banner above upload area
- Shows when user doesn't have personal API key
- Explains system key has limited usage
- Direct link to Profile page to add key

**Message:**
> "You're using the system API key which has very limited usage. For unlimited resume parsing, please add your free personal Groq API key."

#### 4. AI Chat Warning (`frontend/src/pages/AIChat.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Warning banner at top of chat interface
- Shows when user doesn't have personal API key
- Explains limitations and provides solution
- Direct link to Profile page

**Message:**
> "AI Chat is using the system API key with very limited usage. For unlimited queries, add your free personal Groq API key."

#### 5. Profile Page Updates (`frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx`)

**Enhanced:**
- Added subtitle: "🎁 **100% Free** - Get your personal Groq API key (no credit card required)"
- Added yellow warning banner when no personal key is configured
- Emphasizes "Personal API Key Required"
- Explains system key limitations

**Warning Banner:**
> "The system API key has very limited usage. Please add your free personal key below to use AI features."

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### New User Journey

1. **User logs in** → Sees dashboard warning banner
2. **User clicks "Upload Resume"** → Sees warning banner
3. **User clicks "AI Chat"** → Sees warning banner  
4. **User clicks "Add Personal API Key"** → Redirects to Profile
5. **Profile page shows:**
   - Yellow warning about system limitations
   - Setup guide with 6 steps
   - Free key benefits
   - API key input with test button
6. **User adds key and enables toggle** → Warnings disappear across all pages
7. **User uploads resume** → Backend logs: `🔑 Using personal API key for user: {email}`

### Visual Indicators

**Without Personal Key:**
```
⚠️ Dashboard: Yellow banner at top
⚠️ Upload: Yellow banner above upload area
⚠️ AI Chat: Yellow banner above chat
⚠️ Profile: Yellow warning + required message
📋 Backend logs: "WARNING: User using system API key (very limited)"
```

**With Personal Key:**
```
✅ Dashboard: No warning
✅ Upload: No warning
✅ AI Chat: No warning
✅ Profile: Green success badge
🔑 Backend logs: "Using personal API key for user: {email}"
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Settings Check

All pages now query user's AI settings:
```typescript
const { data: aiSettings } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['profile-ai-settings'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await api.get('/profile/ai-settings')
    return response.data
  }
})
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "has_personal_key": false,
  "use_personal_ai_key": false,
  "key_preview": null
}
```

### Warning Display Logic

```typescript
{aiSettings && (!aiSettings.has_personal_key || !aiSettings.use_personal_ai_key) && (
  <WarningBanner />
)}
```

Banner shows when:
- User has NO personal key, OR
- User has personal key but hasn't enabled it

## 📊 System Behavior

### Before This Change

- ✅ System API key used by default
- ❌ No warnings to users
- ❌ No encouragement to add personal keys
- 📈 High system API usage
- 💰 System owner pays for all API calls

### After This Change

- ⚠️ System API key still works (limited)
- ✅ Clear warnings on all AI-related pages
- ✅ Strong encouragement to add personal keys
- ✅ Easy setup process (6-step guide)
- 📉 Reduced system API usage
- 💰 Users pay for their own API calls (free tier)
- 🚀 Users get faster performance (llama-3.1-8b-instant)

## 🔒 Enforcement Level

**Current Implementation: Soft Enforcement**

- System key still works
- Warnings shown to users
- Backend logs warnings
- Strong UI nudges to add personal key

**Future Option: Hard Enforcement**

To completely block system API usage, modify `ai_service.py`:

```python
async def analyze_resume(...):
    if not (current_user and current_user.use_personal_ai_key):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Personal API key required. Please add your free Groq API key at /profile"
        )
    
    user_api_key = current_user.personal_groq_api_key
    service = get_ai_service(user_api_key)
    # ...
```

This would:
- ❌ Block all AI operations without personal key
- 🚫 Show error message in UI
- 🔑 Force users to configure personal key

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Personal Key Adoption Rate**
   - Track % of users with personal keys configured
   - Monitor via database query:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE use_personal_ai_key = true) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as adoption_rate
   FROM users;
   ```

2. **System API Usage Reduction**
   - Monitor backend logs for "WARNING" vs "Using personal API key"
   - Track API costs/usage

3. **User Experience**
   - Monitor support tickets related to API limits
   - Track time-to-configure personal key
