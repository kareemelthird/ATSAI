# ðŸ¤– AI-Driven ATS Data Strategy

## **Thinking Like an AI: What Data Matters for HR**

### **The AI's Perspective**

When I (the AI) read a CV, I'm not just looking for keywords. I'm trying to understand:

1. **Career Trajectory**: How has this person grown? Junior â†’ Mid â†’ Senior â†’ Lead?
2. **Domain Expertise**: What industries/domains do they truly understand?
3. **Technical Depth**: Are they a specialist or generalist? How deep is their knowledge?
4. **Leadership Potential**: Have they managed teams? Led projects? Mentored others?
5. **Cultural Fit**: What company sizes have they worked in? What methodologies?
6. **Practical Experience**: What have they actually BUILT? What impact did they have?
7. **Learning Ability**: How quickly do they pick up new skills? Are they self-taught?
8. **Communication**: Can they articulate complex ideas? Multiple languages?

## **Data I Extract from Your CV**

### **1. Identity & Contact**
```
âœ… Full Name
âœ… Email (unique identifier)
âœ… Phone
âœ… Current Location
âœ… LinkedIn, GitHub, Portfolio URLs
```
**Why**: To contact and verify you. LinkedIn/GitHub show your professional network and code quality.

---

### **2. Professional Summary & Level**
```
âœ… AI-Generated Summary (2-3 sentences capturing your essence)
âœ… Career Level (Entry/Mid/Senior/Lead/Manager/Director/Executive)
âœ… Total Years of Experience
âœ… One-Line Summary ("Senior Full-Stack Developer with 8 years in Fintech")
âœ… Elevator Pitch (selling points)
```
**Why**: HR needs to quickly understand "who you are" in 10 seconds.

**Example**:
- Summary: "Experienced Document Controller with 7 years in construction and oil & gas industries. Expert in document management systems, ISO compliance, and cross-functional team coordination."
- Career Level: Senior
- One-Liner: "Senior Document Controller specializing in construction project documentation"

---

### **3. Skills (The Most Critical Part)**

For EACH skill, I extract:
```
âœ… Skill Name (Python, Document Control, SAP, etc.)
âœ… Category (Technical, Soft, Language, Tool, Methodology)
âœ… Type (Programming, Framework, Database, Cloud, Document Management)
âœ… Proficiency Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)
âœ… Years of Experience (3.5 years with Python)
âœ… Last Used Date (still using it or outdated?)
âœ… How Acquired (Self-taught, Course, Work, Formal Education)
âœ… Certifications (if skill is certified)
âœ… Evidence (number of projects using this skill)
```

**Why HR Needs This**:
- "Find me someone with **Advanced** Python skills, used within the last **6 months**"
- "Who has **3+ years** of Document Control experience?"
- "Show me candidates with **Expert-level** proficiency in ISO standards"

**Example for Document Controller**:

âœ… Category (expertise, experience_type, soft_skill, industry)
âœ… Confidence Level (95% sure this tag applies)
