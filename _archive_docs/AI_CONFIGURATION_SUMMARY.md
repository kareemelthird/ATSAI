### Use Case 2: Customize Resume Analysis
**Example**: You want AI to always extract certifications
1. Edit "Resume Analysis Instructions"
2. Add: "CRITICAL: Always extract ALL certifications with expiry dates"
3. Save
4. Upload CV → AI prioritizes certifications

### Use Case 3: Change Chat Tone
**Example**: Want shorter, data-driven responses
1. Edit "Chat System Instructions"
2. Change to: "Provide concise bullet-point answers with metrics"
3. Save
4. Ask question → Get shorter, quantitative responses
