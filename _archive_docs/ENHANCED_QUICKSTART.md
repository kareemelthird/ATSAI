## Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: Backup Current Database (Optional but Recommended)**
```powershell
# Backup current database

- ✅ Takes ~30 seconds

**Expected output**:
```
🔄 Starting database migration to enhanced schema...
📝 Step 1: Adding new columns to candidates table...
   ✅ Added: preferred_locations
   ✅ Added: open_to_relocation
   ... (60+ more)
✅ Migration completed successfully!
```

```

---

### **Step 4: Restart Backend**
